# 🦆🐍 sixcube 🦀🐝

(in development)
if you have any name ideas, condsider a pull request to `name_ideas`. (currently using sixcube)


## Goals:

plugins (aka mods) via self contained packages. Safety over capabilities. If you want the API to do something, you're welcome to make a pull request :D (?)

plugins written in many languages. Current thinking is to use WASM with [exitsm](extism.org)(?)

*cubic* chunk system (?)

LOD for chunk rendering (requires support for loading chunks at arbitrary levels of detail.) unlimited "render distance" (?)

decoupled rendering system to allow for renderer plugins. (?)
