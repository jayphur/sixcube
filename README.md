# 🦆🐍 sixcube 🦀🐝

(in development)
if you have any name ideas, condsider a pull request to `name_ideas`. (currently using sixcube)


## Goals:

plugins (aka mods) via self contained packages. Safety over capabilities. If you want the API to do something, you're welcome to make a pull request :D (?)

plugins written in python or maybe rust too. Current thinking is to compile down to C and dynamically link (?)

cubic chunk system for endless and expansive maps (?)

Unlimited LOD for chunk rendering (requires support for loading chunks at arbitrary levels of detail.) unlimited "render distance" (?)

async chunk loading (?)

highly parallel (?)

multiplayer (?)

decoupled rendering system to allow for renderer plugins. (?)
